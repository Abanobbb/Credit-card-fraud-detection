It is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase

The datasets contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders.
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

Data contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, there is no original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, â€¦ V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning. Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.

Using the original data set would not prove to be a good idea for a very simple reason: Since over 99% of our transactions are non-fraudulent, an algorithm that always predicts that the transaction is non-fraudulent would achieve an accuracy higher than 99%. Nevertheless, that is the opposite of what we want. We do not want a 99% accuracy that is achieved by never labeling a transaction as fraudulent, we want to detect fraudulent transactions and label them as such.
